<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

- <b>Power Computation & Optimization  </b>

   -Implemented and analyzed more than five power computation algorithms using recursion and iteration.

  -Designed and optimized an exponentiation function, reducing computation steps by 30% through divide-and-conquer.

  -Debugged infinite loop issues and improved recursion depth tracking, ensuring 100% pass rate on basic tests. 
  - [Power Coursework](https://github.com/cn22518)
- <b>List Data Structure Implementation  </b>

  -Designed and implemented a memory-efficient doubly linked list in C, utilizing pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

  -Ensured correct memory management and prevented memory leaks, ensuring optimal performance and passing 94% of test
cases.

  -Achieved 94% correctness and functionality, resolving segmentation faults and optimizing performance to pass 144 out of 153
test cases. 
  - [List Coursework](https://github.com/cn22518) 
- <b>Image Converter </b>

  -Engineered a PGM-to-SK converter, processing over 100 test cases with a 98% success rate.

  -Applied data transformation techniques, achieving up to 50% file size reduction.

  -Refined the code into modular, reusable functions, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
